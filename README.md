# Snake_Game
The Snake Game with Special High-Scoring Food is a classic arcade-style game implemented using the Pygame library in Python.
The game features a snake that moves around the screen, consuming regular food to grow longer. Additionally, the game introduces 
a special high-scoring food item that appears at regular intervals. The objective of the game is to control the snake, guide it 
towards both regular and high-scoring food items, and avoid colliding with itself or the boundaries of the game screen.
The game environment consists of a grid layout, and the player controls the snake's movement using arrow keys. Eating regular
food increases the player's score by 10 points, while consuming the high-scoring food grants a higher score value of 50 points. 
The special food item appears every 5 seconds, adding an element of time pressure and excitement to the gameplay.
The Snake Game with Special High-Scoring Food is designed to challenge players' reflexes, strategic thinking, and ability to manage
time effectively. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by strategically controlling the snake's movements to eat both
types of food items while avoiding collisions. The game provides an engaging and entertaining experience for players of all ages and skill levels.
Overall, this project demonstrates the effective implementation of the classic Snake game mechanics and introduces a twist with the 
introduction of high-scoring food. With its simple yet addictive gameplay, the Snake Game with Special High-Scoring Food promises hours of fun and entertainment for players.
